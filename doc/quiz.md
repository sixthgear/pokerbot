Poker Hand Evaluator
====================

With all the recent talk on ##proggit about poker recently, I thought a new poker
themed proggitquiz might be appropriate.

The task for this challenge is relatively simple. In short we will be writing a
poker hand evaluator. What that means is given a list of poker hands, your 
program should rank them and determine which one (or ones) is the winning hand.

The most popular variant of poker is called Texas Hold'em. In Hold 'em, 
each player is dealt two cards that they keep secret. Five community cards are
dealt face up on the table. The winning player is the one who has the best five-card
hand, made up from any combination of their own cards (hole cards) and the five 
community cards on the board.
